A front matter with a custom description for a page:

```yaml
layout: libdoc_page
description: Just added a description to front matter
```

A page with the above front matter is not linked into the main/primary menu and there is no breadcrumb. To enable link item in the primary navigation, `eleventyNavigation.key` must be set into the [front matter](/content/front-matter/index.md).
