Useful when a selected page have different language than the default. Here is a front matter with a page language overridden:

```yaml
layout: libdoc_page
language: fr
```

If `language` is set, the user interface automatically switches to the language specified. Every UI interface element gets text values from the specified language that must be supported into `_data/libdocMessages.json`, otherwise, blank UI elements texts may appear.

Note that a page with the above front matter is not linked into the main/primary menu and there is no breadcrumb. To enable link item in the primary navigation, `eleventyNavigation.key` must be set into the [front matter](/content/front-matter/index.md).
