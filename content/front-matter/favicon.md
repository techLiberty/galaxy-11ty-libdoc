Allows to customize the favicon on any page. By default, favicon is already set into [LibDoc configuration favicon](/content/configuration/favicon.md). You can customize it on any page by entering another favicon URL into the front matter key `faviconUrl`.

```yaml
layout: libdoc_page
faviconUrl: /path-to/special-favicon.png
```
