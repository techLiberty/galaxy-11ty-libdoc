This page illustrates renders of all different markdown tags. Learn more about [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Paragraph and carriage return

At glance: Double carriage return renders a paragraph, single carriage return renders ... a simple carriage return. Here is an example.

First paragraph: Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna elitr consetetur sea tempor, elitr dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem. Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.

Second paragraph because of double carriage return. Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna elitr consetetur sea tempor, elitr dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem. Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.

Paragraph: Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna elitr consetetur sea tempor, elitr dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem. Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.
Single carriage return done, still the same paragraph: Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna elitr consetetur sea tempor, elitr dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem. Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.

```markdown

## Unordered lists

To create unordered lists, use asterisks `*` or `+` or `-` followed by space. To create unordered lists into unordered list items, indent your text just like the following example.

* I am the first item of the unordered list
* I am the second item and i contain another unordered list
    - Small item
    - Another unordered list into an item
        + Sub sub item
        + Another sub sub item.
        + A sub sub item containing multiple paragraphs. Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna elitr consetetur sea tempor, elitr dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem. Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.
        + Penultimate item.
        + And this is the latest item.
    - Sub Or pluses
    - Sub And another item.
    - Sub And another item.
* Voluptua vero consetetur sadipscing.
* Dolores justo sadipscing gubergren magna.
* Justo dolore vero stet ea dolores lorem.


```markdown

## Ordered lists

LibDoc supports automatic nestable bullet numbering. Incremental writing is optional. You can set `1.`on every item. Here is an example taken from [Geologic time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale).

1. Hadean Eon (4567–4030 Ma)
1. Chaotian Era/Erathem (4567–4404 Ma) – the name alluding both to the mythological Chaos and the chaotic phase of planet formation.
1. Jack Hillsian or Zirconian Era/Erathem (4404–4030 Ma) – both names allude to the Jack Hills Greenstone Belt which provided the oldest mineral grains on Earth, zircons.
1. Archean Eon/Eonothem (4030–2420 Ma)
1. Paleoarchean Era/Erathem (4030–3490 Ma)
1. Acastan Period/System (4030–3810 Ma) – named after the Acasta Gneiss, one of the oldest preserved pieces of continental crust.
1. Isuan Period/System (3810–3490 Ma) – named after the Isua Greenstone Belt.
1. Mesoarchean Era/Erathem (3490–2780 Ma)
1. Vaalbaran Period/System (3490–3020 Ma) – based on the names of the Kaapvaal (Southern Africa) and Pilbara (Western Australia) cratons, to reflect the growth of stable continental nuclei or proto-cratonic kernels.
1. Pongolan Period/System (3020–2780 Ma) – named after the Pongola Supergroup, in reference to the well preserved evidence of terrestrial microbial communities in those rocks.
1. Neoarchean Era/Erathem (2780–2420 Ma)
1. Methanian Period/System (2780–2630 Ma) – named for the inferred predominance of methanotrophic prokaryotes

1. Paleoproterozoic Era/Erathem (2420–1780 Ma)
1. Oxygenian Period/System (2420–2250 Ma) – named for displaying the first evidence for a global oxidising atmosphere.
1. Jatulian or Eukaryian Period/System (2250–2060 Ma) – names are respectively for the Lomagundi–Jatuli δ13C isotopic excursion event spanning its duration, and for the (proposed) first fossil appearance of eukaryotes.
1. Columbian Period/System (2060–1780 Ma) – named after the supercontinent Columbia.
1. Mesoproterozoic Era/Erathem (1780–850 Ma)

## Brackets links

The most simple way to create a link.

<https://github.com/ita-design-system/eleventy-libdoc>

```markup
<https://github.com/ita-design-system/eleventy-libdoc>
```

## Internal links

Easily create links between your project pages. Eleventy allows to create dynamic links, you set the path to the source file and the link URL is automatically rendered.

**`permalink` must be set into the destination page**. If permalink changes on destination page, internal links pointing to this page change accordingly.

[Bring me to the page ./markdown.md](/content/creating-content/markdown.md)

```markdown
[Bring me to the page ./markdown.md](/content/creating-content/markdown.md)
```

Links <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to pages that does not set `permalink` **don’t change automatically** but works fine.

[Bring me to the page ./markdown.md](/markdown/)

```markdown
[Bring me to the page ./markdown.md](/markdown/)
```

## Reference links

Reference links allows to assign text shortcuts to <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and are useful when this URL is used multiple times. *Reference links are case insensitive*. Example:

I am a paragraph that contains [multiple links][1] with the same [URL][1].
[Permalinks][2] are set at the beginning of every page into the [front matter][2]
The [Geologic Time Scale][Geologic Time Scale] or geological time scale
([GTS][geologic time scale]) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth. 

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
[2]: /front-matter/
[geologic time scale]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale

```markdown

The [Geologic Time Scale][Geologic Time Scale] or geological time scale
([GTS][geologic time scale]) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth. 

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
[2]: /front-matter/
[geologic time scale]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale
```

Note that dynamic links to file input path don’t work on reference links. 
`[1]: /content/front-matter/index.md` Does not work.

## Links with title

Optionnaly, you can add a title attribute to your markdown links, adding a space and a text between quotes after link <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>.

[Dynamic link to front matter](/content/front-matter/index.md "Go to front matter")

```markup
[Dynamic link to front matter](/content/front-matter/index.md "Go to front matter")
```

## Images

To optimize page performances and bandwidth, raster images like PNG, JPEG, GIF are transcoded into [AVIF][avif wiki] and [WEBP][webp wiki] format through [Eleventy Image Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/). In addition, to support responsiveness, every raster image is transcoded into multiple files with different widths to fit target devices.

Vector images are used as is.

### Local images

Here is a simple case with a raster image

![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg)

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg) 
```

Here is a simple case with a vector image

![Alt text](/assets/images/grue-royale.svg) 

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/grue-royale.svg) 
```

[avif wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF
[webp wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEBP

Example of an image with a dynamic link.
[![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images)

Optionally add a title attribute
[![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images "Go to Markdown page section Images")

```markdown
Example of an image with a dynamic link. 
[![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images)

Optionally add a title attribute
[![Alt text](/assets/images/pierra-menta.jpg)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images "Go to Markdown page section Images")
```

Here is an example of a markdown link including a raster image with its natural width smaller than main content width

[![alt text](/favicon.png)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images "Go to Markdown page section Images").

*Please note that, awaiting enhancement, raster images smaller than main content width do not render properly on high density displays like Retina.*

Here is an example of a markdown link including a vector image with its natural width smaller than main content width

[![alt text](/assets/images/info.svg)](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#images "Go to Markdown page section Images").

### Remote images

Remote images are processed just like [local images](#local-images) through Eleventy Image Plugin.

A JPEG remote image
![Young marmots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivier3lanc/photographies/master/animaux/sauvages/img_4417.jpg) 

Small remote SVG logo
![SVG Logo Scroll Btween](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivier3lanc/Scroll-Btween/refs/heads/master/img/logo-scroll-btween.svg)

```markdown

Small remote SVG logo
![SVG Logo Scroll Btween](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivier3lanc/Scroll-Btween/refs/heads/master/img/logo-scroll-btween.svg)
```

### Reference images

Just like [reference links](#reference-links), you can assign text shortcuts to absolute or relative image URL. This avoids repeating same URL multiple times. Here is an example below.

![alt text][gypaetus]

[gypaetus]: /assets/images/gypaetus-barbatus-peisey.jpg "Gypaetus Barbatus flying"

```markdown
![alt text][gypaetus]

[gypaetus]: /assets/images/gypaetus-barbatus-peisey.jpg "Gypaetus Barbatus flying"
```

## Inline code

To display very short length of `code`, just `use the **following** # syntax`.

```markup
To display very short length of `code`, just `use the **following** # syntax`.
```

## Syntax highlighting

You can highlight code based on your [Highlight JS configuration](/content/configuration/hljs.md).

1. Enter three back-ticks ` ``` ` followed by the language [alias](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html)
2. Enter your code to highlight
3. End with the same ` ``` ` into a new line.

Example of syntax highlighting with HTML

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is a <a href="/link/">link</a>.</p>
```

Markdown code

```markdown
    ```html
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a <a href="/link/">link</a>.</p>
    ```
```

Example of syntax highlighting with Javascript

```javascript
const m = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(m);
```

Markdown code

```markdown
    ```javascript
    const m = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(m);
    ```
```

Example of syntax highlighting with Liquid. Encapsulate code into `raw ... endraw` [raw paired shortcodes](https://liquidjs.com/tags/raw.html).

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign filePath = "." | append: path %}
{% sandboxFile path, title %}{% include filePath %}{% endsandboxFile %}{% endraw %}
```

Markdown code

```markdown
    ```liquid
    {% raw %}{% assign filePath = "." | append: path %}
    {% sandboxFile path, title %}{% include filePath %}{% endsandboxFile %}{% endraw %}
    ```
```

Example of syntax highlighting with unspecified code

```
No language specified may render unwanted result, please specify.
```

```markdown
    ```
    No language specified may render unwanted result, please specify.
    ```
```

## Tables

Table markdown was made by [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-) as an extension of the [Markdown specifications](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Tables are responsive and with horizontal scroll enabled if its content is wider than the max width of the main content wrapper.
