In addition of common [markdown](/content/creating-content/markdown.md), it is possible to use some raw HTML tags.

## Abbr

With <abbr title="Eleventy">11ty</abbr> you can use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style your
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Title attribute is optional but if set, `<abbr>` tags are clickable and expanded once on click.

<aside>
    <p class="alert alert-success">
        On Eleventy LibDoc, abbreviation elements with title attribute 
        are clickable just like 
        <abbr title="Exempli Gratia">E.G.</abbr>
    </p>

## Line break

* **I am an item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to break the line inside markdown
* **I am another item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to re-break the line inside markdown
* **I am the ultimate item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to re-re-break the line inside markdown


```markdown
* **I am an item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to break the line
* **I am another item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to re-break the line
* **I am the ultimate item** <br>
    Sometimes it comes we need to re-re-break the line
```

## Links

Just like [Markdown internal links](/content/creating-content/markdown.md#internal-links), you can write dynamic HTML links pointing to input path and then easily create links between your project pages. **`permalink` must be set into the destination page**. If permalink changes on destination page, internal links pointing to this page change accordingly. 

Of course, non-dynamic links work too! Here is an example:

Let’s go to <a href="/content/creating-content/markdown.md">Markdown</a> page (dynamic link) 
or <a href="/content/front-matter/index.md">Front matter</a> page (dynamic link) 
or <a href="/content/front-matter/front-matter-minimal/">minimal</a> page (static link) 

```html
Let’s go to <a href="/content/creating-content/markdown.md">Markdown</a> page (dynamic link) 
or <a href="/content/front-matter/index.md">Front matter</a> page (dynamic link) 
or <a href="/content/front-matter/front-matter-minimal/">minimal</a> page (static link) 
```
