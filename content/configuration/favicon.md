It is possible to override default favicon by entering a root relative URL or absolute URL to it. Available into `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "faviconUrl": "/my/own/path/favicon.png"
}
```

Favicon URL is applied following these ordered priorities:

1. By default favicon URL’s value is `settings.faviconUrl` if nothing is set into the front matter.
1. If `faviconUrl` is set into the front matter, page’s favicon URL gets this value.
